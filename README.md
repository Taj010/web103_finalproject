## About

### Description and Purpose

StickerStory is a digital memory journal that lets users creatively capture and preserve their favorite moments. Users can create multiple journals and fill each journal with scrapbook-style pages. On each page, users can upload photos, add decorative stickers, doodles, and text, and attach labels, descriptions, locations, and dates. To make pages more personal, users have the option of responding to random prompts and even attach a Spotify song to capture the mood of the moment.

The purpose of StickerStory is to give users a fun, creative, and interactive way to document memories and reflect on their experiences. It combines journaling, scrapbooking, and music in one app, making it both personal and shareable for users who want to save and revisit their favorite moments over time.

### Inspiration
Our inspiration stems from the nostalgia of physical scrapbooking combined with the modern convenience of digital journaling apps. We aimed to create an experience that transcends simple text-based logs, providing a rich, visual, and highly personal way to document life. The inclusion of stickers and doodling mimics the tactile joy of paper scrapbooks, while features like Spotify integration and prompt generation add a unique digital twist to the memory-capturing experience.
