## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Designing the low-fidelity wireframes for our project went really well. Our group had similar ideas about how we wanted StickerStory to look and function, so the process felt smooth and collaborative. It was fun seeing our ideas come to life visually and realizing we were all on the same page about the app’s layout and features.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

One challenge we faced was narrowing down all of our ideas into something that’s realistic for our timeline. We had a lot of creative concepts—like music integration and sticker customization—but had to decide which ones were essential for the first version of our app. It was also a bit tricky coordinating what parts we should do, so communication took some extra effort.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

As we move forward, we’ll need more support with the technical side of implementation—especially setting up the database relationships (like many-to-many tables) and integrating external APIs such as Spotify. We’d also appreciate guidance on front-end design tools or techniques to help us make the sticker and collage features both functional and visually appealing.
