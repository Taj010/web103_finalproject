## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We were able to organize and divide the work effectively and complete the implementations easily, and there have been no merge issues so far. 

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

The initial setup and how to set up the file structures were something we had to think about. 

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

Yes, we were able to implement the features we wanted and have the journal pages and setup we wanted for this milestone. 

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The Auto-Generated Starter Pages feature, I think it's "at risk" because this feature was introduced as a stretch goal rather than a core requirement. Our current focus is on delivering a solid journaling and scrapbooking experience. Auto-generating starter pages involves additional complexity, such as template creation and logic for personalization, which may divert resources from the primary goal.


### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Perhaps show how to pull from the main branch without conflicts and test the code written by others more efficiently; that would be helpful.
